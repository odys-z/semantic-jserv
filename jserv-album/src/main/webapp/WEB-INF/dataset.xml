	<!-- This table is used for define sqls that can be parameterized when serving data.
		Client using 'sk' in request message to use sqls.
		conn: Optional, the conn-id overriding client's URI's conn-id. use case: cbb is binding source different from URI.
		Records returned by sql can be mapped into bump cases (for oracle) if 'cols' is not empty.
		Different version of sql, mysql, oracle, etc. is used according to connId and driver type,
		see connects.xml. 
		s-tree: if this field is defined, the retrieved records is translated in to an STree. For field index, see class TreeSemantics.Ix.

		NOTE: Because semantic-jserv and jclient are case sensitive,
			  it's strongly recommended that all oracle selected columns should being double quoted.
